                                                The Bank has disclosed business segment as the primary segment. The Bank
                                                primarily operates in India, hence the Bank has considered that its operations are
                                                predominantly in the domestic segment and as such there are no reportable
                                                geographical segments.

                                                purposes are based on the management’s judgment and perception of how the
                                                business is carried on by the Bank. Further, inter-segment income and expense
                                                has been determined using an internally developed transfer pricing rate and is
