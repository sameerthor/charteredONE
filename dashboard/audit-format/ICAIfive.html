                                                            In the case of a small entity, some or all of these considerations may be
                                                            inapplicable or less relevant. For example, a smaller entity may not have
                                                            a written code of conduct but, instead, may have developed a culture

                                                            oral communication and by management example. Domination of
                                                            management by a single individual in a small entity does not generally, in and of itself, indicate a failure by management to display and
                                                            communicate an appropriate attitude regarding internal control and the
                                                            financial reporting process. In some entities, the need for management
                                                            authorization can compensate for otherwise deficient controls and

                                                            by a single individual can be a potential weakness since there is an

                                                            relating to revenue recognition often results from an overstatement of
                                                            revenues through, for example, premature revenue recognition or
                                                            recording fictitious revenues. It may result also from an understatement
                                                            of revenues through, for example, improperly shifting revenues to a later
                                                            period. (Para A28)

                                                            than others. For example, there may be pressures or incentives on
                                                            management to commit fraudulent financial reporting through

                                                            growth or profit. Similarly, for example, there may be greater risks of
